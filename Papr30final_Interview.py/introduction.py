I worked as a Senior Software Engineer in Anuta Networks for 11 years. 

I was involved in validating our product ATOM, it is a service orchestration tool and also assurance platform.
It supports greenfield and brownfield services. 
ATOM handles discovery of devices and services,apart from that it also supports zero-touch provisioning (ZTP), inventory and configuration management,
also compliance checks, and it supports multiple vendor support.


So coming to my responsibilities:

I involved in verifying device inventory, configuration accuracy, and network topology visualization.
Also participated to validate the services for different customers.
And performing OS upgrades manually and also through workflows (stateless) for Juniper and Cisco devices. (for device types EX, ACX, QFX, and Cisco NCS .)
I used to validate network monitoring by using the protocols like SNMP, syslogs, and telemetry.So it ensures real-time visibility and enable closed-loop automation through alert correlation.
And also I used to maintain the functional, regression and use case suites.
Once the test suite runs I used to analyse the test reports, and fix if there are any scripts issues, and raising merge requests for them.
If not the script issues then raise the bugs in JIRA.
And also tracking the status of raised bugs and tasks.
Collaborating with development team and peers to discuss about the test cases.So we will make sure to not miss any corner scenarios and negative scenarios.
Also have experience in managing a team of 5. I used to assign the tasks and test cases to them.
